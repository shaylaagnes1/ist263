    <My name is Shayla Ismael and I am currently majoring in public relations while minoring in innovation, designs, and startups. I chose this major because I am very interested in working in the fashion and beauty industry. I plan to become a campaign manager or work in event/production. I am very proud of my work ethic and have a variety of accomplishments. These range from receiving a full scholarship to Syracuse to now being the Editor In Chief of a campus magazine. Outside of work I enjoy thrift shopping, going to workout classes, and reading mystery books. A fun fact about is I am currently training to become a spin instructor.
