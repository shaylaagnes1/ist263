      <h2>Personal Info</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Shayla Ismael, and I am currently majoring in Public Relations while minoring in
        Innovation, Design, and Startups. I chose this path because I am deeply interested in the fashion
        and beauty industry, and I hope to work in campaign management or event production.
      </p>

      <p>
        I pride myself on my work ethic and the accomplishments I’ve achieved so far—from earning a full
        scholarship to Syracuse University to becoming the Editor-in-Chief of a campus magazine. Outside of
        work and school, I enjoy thrift shopping, attending workout classes, and reading mystery books.
        A fun fact about me is that I am currently training to become a spin instructor.
      </p>

      <p><strong>I am excited to help plan your next event!</strong></p>
